Fork of the official Clojurescript node repl. Allows the nodejs process to be started separately from the Clojurescript repl, so that it can be run on a separate host.
May be useful for working on ARM-based computers (like the Raspberry Pi), where running a Clojure repl would be heavyweight, compared to just running a node process.
